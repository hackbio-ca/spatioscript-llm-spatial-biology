By combining single-cell RNA sequencing with spatial transcriptomics, SpatioScript helps uncover how cells are organized and interact in the tumour microenvironment. Users can simply ask questions like “Are CD8+ T cells enriched in the tumour core?” and get biologically meaningful answers. The platform lowers the barrier to exploring complex datasets and bridges image-based pathology with high-dimensional molecular data making spatial biology more accessible to scientists and clinicians."],"metadata":{"id":"vWcZMIzE3dTy"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"gzm-F4t_bltT"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd      #
